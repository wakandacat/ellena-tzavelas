                    <h3 className="blurb">Hello! Iâ€™m Ellena Tzavelas, a recent graduate of the joint Carleton-Algonquin Bachelor of Information Technology Interactive Multimedia and Design program. This fantastic program gave me the opportunity to dabble in a plethora of multimedia topics from illustration and design, 3D modeling and physics based animation, software design, audio and video, and human-computer interactions. My academic experiences have ignited my passion for software, web and game development. <br/><br/>I completed a year of university co-op placements at Nokia and Irdeto which allowed me to put my education into practice and helped me to broaden my skills in many technologies (and soft skills too!). <br/><br/>In my spare time, I enjoy playing video games, reading sci-fi fantasy, gardening and cooking.</h3>
