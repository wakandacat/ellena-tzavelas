        {"Title": "Hangman",
            "Desc": "As a way to teach myself React.js, I created a simple game of hangman. Initially created a few years ago as a semi-functional and poorly structured program, it has since been remade with React best practices I picked up at my university co-op placement. The goal is to provide the player with a random Wikipedia article title to guess from the Wikipedia API. The style of the game is heavily influenced by the UI of the video game Persona 5, which also makes use of tarot cards like the Hanged Man.",

Any irregular letters, numbers, or punctuation characters are shown."},{"img": "hangman2.PNG", "alt": "Players can choose to play on 3 difficulty modes. Easy is the default and allows 10 incorrect guesses before a game over, Hard allows 5 and None allows infinite."},{"img": "hangman3.png", "alt": "Once the title has been successfully guessed, a game over is triggered, or the Give Up button is clicked, the title will allow users to click on it to take them to the corresponding Wikipedia article."}],

        {"Title": "Persona 3 Background",
            "Desc": "A computer background created using Vue.js and deployed to Wallpaper Engine. Initially created using vanilla JavaScript a few years ago, I decided to recreate it with Vue to significantly cut down on the length and improve the cleanliness of the code. The goal of this project was to imitate the UI from the video game Persona 3 Portable, one of my personal favourites. This background displays the current date, the time of day, the phase of the moon and indicates how many days are left until a full moon, all of which is good to keep track of for both myself and the game characters. The background images are pulled directly from the game files.",
            "Image": [{"img": "p3back.PNG", "alt": "As the game characters attend high school, After School is one of the times of day listed in the UI. Others include Morning, Lunch, Evening and Late Night."},{"img": "p3back2.PNG", "alt": "More memorable phases of the moon, such as Quarter, Half and Full moons are spelled out directly."},{"img": "p3back4.PNG", "alt": "Notable times of day and background images are different during weekends."},{"img": "p3back3.PNG", "alt": "Following with the game, the 'hidden hour' after midnight changes the UI to green. As an extra hour per day does not exist in real life, real-time 12am to 1am take its place."}],

        {"Title": "Mobile Event Scheduler",
            "Desc": "This Proof-of-Concept mobile application was created as an individual assignment for my 4th year Mobile App Development course. The goal was to create an event scheduler that allows users to view, add, update, delete events, and notify users of upcoming events. Multiple early designs that fit the specifications along with standard mobile app design theories were drawn out on paper, and the best few created as wireframes using Balsamiq. The final design, chosen for its simpler design and for its task completion time in with a predictive modeling software, was then created using Android Studio with Java. As a proof of concept, the app is not fully functional, but it does demonstrate the intended design and functionality, including multiple pages with Android Fragments, and data storage with ViewModels.",

We created a controller shaped as a crow to control a crow on screen with the goal of bringing items back to its nest. The Arduino UNO controller has an IR sensor underneath to detect height, a pressure sensor in each wing to allow players to hold and carry items, a button on each wing to flip the crow's direction on screen, and an RGB LED as each eye to indicate various states within the game.",

I was also responsible for the majority of the environmental scripting such as the conveyor belts, moving platforms, and vent systems.
