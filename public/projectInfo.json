        {"Title": "Hangman",
            "Desc": "As a way to teach myself React.js, I created a simple game of hangman. Initially created a few years ago as a semi-functional and poorly structured program, it has since been remade with React best practices I picked up at my university co-op placement. The goal is to provide the player with a random Wikipedia article title to guess from the Wikipedia API. The style of the game is heavily influenced by the UI of the video game Persona 5, which also makes use of tarot cards like the Hanged Man.",
            "Image": [{"img": "hangman1.PNG", "alt": "All English letters (Aa-Zz) are hidden from the player. Any irregular letters, numbers, or punctuation characters are shown."},{"img": "hangman2.PNG", "alt": "Players can choose to play on 3 difficulty modes. Easy is the default and allows 10 incorrect guesses before a game over, Hard allows 5 and None allows infinite."},{"img": "hangman3.png", "alt": "Once the title has been successfully guessed, a game over is triggered, or the Give Up button is clicked, the title will allow users to click on it to take them to the corresponding Wikipedia article."}],

        {"Title": "Persona 3 Background",
            "Desc": "A computer background created using Vue.js and deployed to Wallpaper Engine. Initially created using vanilla JavaScript a few years ago, I decided to recreate it with Vue to significantly cut down on the length and improve the cleanliness of the code. The goal of this project was to imitate the UI from the video game Persona 3 Portable, one of my personal favourites. This background displays the current date, the time of day, the phase of the moon and indicates how many days are left until a full moon, all of which is good to keep track of for both myself and the game characters. The background images are pulled directly from the game files.",
            "Image": [{"img": "p3back.PNG", "alt": "As the game characters attend high school, After School is one of the times of day listed in the UI. Others include Morning, Lunch, Evening and Late Night."},{"img": "p3back2.PNG", "alt": "More memorable phases of the moon, such as Quarter, Half and Full moons are spelled out directly."},{"img": "temp.jpg", "alt": "Notable times of day and background images are different during weekends."},{"img": "temp2.jpg", "alt": "A major concept of the game is a hidden hour after midnight everyday called the Dark Hour where everything becomes a sickly green, the world distorts, and monsters roam about."}],
